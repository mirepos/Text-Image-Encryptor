  <h1>FAQ Section for more info</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Does it work in my Browser?</strong><br>
    &rsaquo; Yes, it does. You only need a local Webserver or simply install it on your Hosting space.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>What does this do?</strong><br>
    &rsaquo; You can store a text file to be hidden within a normal PNG, JPG or GIF image file. 
    The output image (always PNG) created would work just as normal, 
    but you’d have the secret text within it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>How do I retrieve the hidden data from within the output file?</strong><br>
    &rsaquo; The Script can be used for hiding and retrieving data. 
    However, if you are sending your file to a friend who doesn’t have the script, 
    just send him/her the standalone extractor script (or a Link to your installed 
    extractor script) that is included.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>How secure is the hidden file?</strong><br>
    &rsaquo; The Script uses a simple algorithm for encoding your hidden data (using your password, 
    if a password is provided) and so, the hidden file cannot be retrieved easily without decoding it first. 
    So, it becomes much more secure than just joining two files using native copy commands. 
    Especially since no one knows that the picture contains hidden text.
    </p>
  
  <p id="hint">
    <strong>❓ What I have to consider.</strong><br>
    &rsaquo; When sending the image with the hidden text, 
    make sure that the image is not compressed (as is the case with WhatsApp, for example) or the text is lost. 
    So always send the image without compression, e.g. by eMail!
